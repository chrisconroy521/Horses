## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ragozin-sheets-parser

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your OpenAI API key
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)

**Optional Environment Variables:**
- `OPENAI_API_BASE`: Custom API endpoint (default: https://api.openai.com/v1)
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: Model to use (default: gpt-4o)
- `BACKEND_HOST`: Backend host (default: localhost)
- `BACKEND_PORT`: Backend port (default: 8000)
- `FRONTEND_PORT`: Frontend port (default: 8501)

### 3. Set OpenAI API Key
```bash
# Option 1: Use the automated setup script (recommended)
python setup_env.py

# Option 2: Edit .env file manually
# Add your API key to the .env file

# Option 3: Use the legacy setup script
python set_api_key.py
```

### 3. Start the System
```bash
# Start both API and frontend
python start.py

# Or start individually:
# API server
uvicorn api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Enhanced frontend
streamlit run streamlit_app_new.py
```

## 🔧 Enhanced Data Structure

### Horse Entry
```python
@dataclass
class HorseEntry:
    name: str
    trainer: str = ""
    races: List[RaceEntry] = None
    horse_analysis: str = ""        # AI-generated overall analysis
    performance_trend: str = ""     # AI-generated trend analysis
```

### Race Entry
```python
@dataclass
class RaceEntry:
    date: str = ""
    track: str = ""
    race_type: str = ""
    ragozin_figure: float = 0.0
    finish_position: int = 0
    odds: float = 0.0
    jockey: str = ""
    weight: float = 0.0
    surface: str = ""
    distance: str = ""
    comments: str = ""
    symbol_before: str = ""         # Symbol before Ragozin figure
    symbol_after: str = ""          # Symbol after Ragozin figure
    race_analysis: str = ""         # AI-generated race analysis
```

- **w**: Won race
- **b**: Bled (nosebleed during race)
- **c**: Claimed (horse was claimed by new owner)

### AI Analysis Examples
- **Race Analysis**: "Strong performance with a Ragozin figure of 85.5, indicating excellent speed. The 'Y' symbol shows the horse had a rail trip advantage, which likely contributed to the win."
- **Horse Analysis**: "This horse demonstrates consistent improvement over recent races, showing strong potential for future success. Best performances on dirt surfaces at distances of 6-7 furlongs."
- **Performance Trend**: "Clear upward trend in performance, with Ragozin figures improving from 90+ to mid-80s range, indicating the horse is hitting peak form."
